    <string name="help_what_title">What is TXTIFY?</string>
    <string name="help_what_content">TXTIFY is a utility that creates a .txt copy of any file. This is useful for uploading source code, scripts, or other documents to services that only accept plain text files, without altering your original file.</string>

    <string name="help_how_title">How to Use</string>
    <string name="help_how_content">
        1.  **Choose a Save Folder:** Use the side menu to select a permanent folder where all your .txt copies will be saved.\n
        2.  **Add Files:** Use "Browse Single File", "Batch Convert Files", or "Process ZIP File" from the menu to add files to the conversion queue.\n
        3.  **Convert:** Your added files will appear as a "project" on the main screen. Tap on it and confirm to save the .txt copies to your chosen folder.

    <string name="help_notes_title">Important Notes</string>
    <string name="help_notes_content">
        - Your original files are never modified.\n
        - By default, if a file named `example.txt` already exists, a new copy will be named `example-1.txt`. You can change this behavior in Settings.\n
        - For Android 10 and above, you must grant folder permissions when prompted to ensure the app can save files.
    </string>

    <string name="help_trouble_title">Troubleshooting</string>
    <string name="help_trouble_content">
        - **"Permission Denied" Errors:** If you see errors about saving files, go to the side menu and use "Choose Save Folder" again to re-grant permission to your target directory.\n
        - **App Crashes:** If the app closes unexpectedly, please use the "Contact Us" button below to send us a message.
